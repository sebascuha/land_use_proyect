## Abstract
This workflow investigates the impact of extreme rainfall shocks on land-use decisions in Colombia, employing a difference-in-differences approach 
with multiple time periods using high-resolution satellite data on land use and historical precipitation records. The study analyzes how farmers 
adapt their land allocation among forestry, pasture, crops and bare ground in response to atypical precipitation patterns. The results reveal a 
significant effect of a reduction in 0.92 pergentage point in crop-covered area while there is an increment on bare land area in 0.24 percentage 
points in municipalities that experienced extreme rainfall. There is no robust proportional increase in land allocated to pastures nor forest when
there is a crop reduction. Instead,the findings suggest that farmers stop cultivating the land and abandon it. Heterogeneity in land concentration 
and soil improvement highlights different responses depending on municipal characteristics. Municipalities with lower land concentration experience 
a greater reduction in cropland, whereas those with higher land concentration show a more pronounced increase in bare land. Similarly, municipalities
where farmers invest in soil improvement are less likely to experience land degradation. These findings contribute to understanding farmers’ coping 
and adaptative behaviors in response to extreme climate events in developing countries, highlighting the challenges of sustainable land management 
amid increasing rainfall shocks.
